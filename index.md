## About Me

I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at **[Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)**, advised by **[Dr. Yunxin Liu](https://yunxinliu.github.io/)**. Prior to this, I received my B.E. degree from **[Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua Univeristy](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)** in 2022.

My research interests include mobile computing, machine learning systems, and large language models (LLMs). I enjoy doing system research and solving pratical challenges. I am currently focused on **<u>building efficient agentic AI systems on edge platforms via system optimization.</u>**

Occasionally sharing thoughts about research, development, etc. See **[Xyu's Blog](https://xxxxyu.github.io/blog)**.
